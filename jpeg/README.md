# Collection of libJPEG Releases

The scripts in this directory can be used to download, build and pack back into
compressed tar archives older versions of libJPEG. Downloading uses the official
source [tarballs] of the project. Building uses a Docker image and requires that
your user is able to build and run containers. GitHub workflow [automation]
arranges to build the latest minor versions of all versions.
